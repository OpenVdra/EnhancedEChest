# Changelog

All notable changes to EnhancedEchest are recorded here, newest first.

## 1.0.2 - 2026-06-27

This release focuses on importing existing data from other vault plugins.

### Added

- Added migration from the `AxVaults` plugin. Items keep their custom names, lore, and enchantments, and each vault maps to the EnhancedEchest chest with the same number.
  - `/ee migrate axvaults` imports every player in the AxVaults database.
  - `/ee migrate axvaults <player>` imports a single player, online or offline.
- Added migration from the `PlayerVaultsX` plugin, read directly from its vault files. Works for offline players.
  - `/ee migrate playervaultsx` imports every player with PlayerVaultsX data.
  - `/ee migrate playervaultsx <player>` imports a single player, online or offline.

### Changed

- **Breaking:** `/ee migrate run` is now `/ee migrate vanilla`, and `/ee migrate run all` is now `/ee migrate vanilla all`. Update any console scripts or command blocks that call the old name.
- **Breaking:** the migration permission node `enhancedechest.admin.migrate.run` is now `enhancedechest.admin.migrate`. Re-grant this node to your staff.

### Improved

- Improved vanilla migration on `Purpur` and Paper forks: enlarged ender chests are now imported in full, up to all 54 slots, instead of only the first 27.
- Improved the update checker so it falls back to GitHub releases when Modrinth cannot be reached, pointing players to the GitHub download instead.
- Improved how chest contents are stored so saved data is more compact.
